# lightyears-m

Light Years is inspired by the classic French card game Mille Bornes, in which two to four players race to be the first to travel 1000 miles while thwarting other players with accidents and engine problems.

This iteration of Light Years was built in Meteor.js, which gave me some excellent experience using MongoDB and Handlebars.
